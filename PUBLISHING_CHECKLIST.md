# 📋 Publishing Checklist

## ✅ Before Publishing to GitHub

### Security Check
- [ ] Verify `.gitignore` includes `github-gist-config.js`
- [ ] Make sure your GitHub token is NOT in any committed files
- [ ] Check that you're using the template file, not the real config
- [ ] Confirm Gist is set to SECRET (not public)

### Files to Include
- [x] `index.html` - Main application
- [x] `styles.css` - Styling
- [x] `script.js` - Application logic
- [x] `github-gist-config.template.js` - Template config (safe)
- [x] `.gitignore` - Protects sensitive files
- [x] `README.md` - Documentation
- [x] `setup-guide.html` - Visual guide
- [x] `CLOUD_SYNC_SETUP.md` - Detailed setup
- [x] `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Quick tips

### Files to EXCLUDE (already in .gitignore)
- [ ] `github-gist-config.js` - Contains your token ⚠️
- [ ] `firebase-config.js` - Not needed
