# 🚀 IndexedDB Upgrade - Complete Guide

## 🎉 MAJOR UPGRADE COMPLETED!

Your Job Tracker now uses **IndexedDB** instead of localStorage, which means:

### ✅ What's New:

1. **Massive Storage Capacity**
   - Old: ~5-10MB total (localStorage)
   - New: **1GB+ storage** (IndexedDB)
   - Can handle **100+ applications** with files easily!

2. **Larger File Uploads**
   - Old: 2MB per file
   - New: **50MB per file**
   - Upload full resumes, portfolios, and documents

3. **Better Performance**
   - Faster data loading
   - Smoother with large datasets
   - No more "QuotaExceededError"!

4. **Automatic Migration**
   - Old localStorage data automatically migrated to IndexedDB
   - First load will transfer everything
   - Old data cleared after migration

## 📖 How It Works

### Storage Architecture:

```
IndexedDB (Primary Storage)
├── Database: "JobTrackerDB"
├── Store: "applications"
├── Indexes: companyName, status, dateApplied
└── Capacity: ~1GB+ (browser dependent)
```

### Storage Limits by Browser:

| Browser | IndexedDB Limit |
|---------|----------------|
| Chrome  | ~60% of disk space (up to several GB) |
| Firefox | ~50% of disk space |
| Safari  | ~1GB (can request more) |
| Edge    | ~60% of disk space (same as Chrome) |

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### First Time Setup:

1. **Open the app** - `http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html`
2. **Wait for migration** - If you had old data, it will auto-migrate
3. **Check notification** - You'll see "Migrated X applications to IndexedDB"
4. **Verify** - Check storage indicator in header

### Storage Indicator:

Look for the storage status in the header:
- 🟢 **Green (0-60%)**: Plenty of space
- 🟡 **Yellow (60-80%)**: Getting full
- 🔴 **Red (80%+)**: Almost full

Example: `Storage: 45.2MB / 1024MB (4.4%)`

## 📁 File Upload Guidelines

### Recommended File Sizes:

| File Type | Recommended | Maximum |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Resume (PDF) | 1-5MB | 50MB |
| Cover Letter | 500KB-2MB | 50MB |
| Portfolio | 5-20MB | 50MB |
| Transcripts | 1-5MB | 50MB |

### Best Practices:

✅ **DO:**
- Compress PDFs before uploading (use smallpdf.com)
- Keep resumes under 5MB for faster loading
- Use meaningful filenames
- Upload only necessary documents

❌ **DON'T:**
- Upload uncompressed scanned documents
- Upload video files (not supported)
- Upload duplicate files
- Upload unnecessary files

---

## 🔧 Features

### 1. Automatic Migration

On first load with IndexedDB:
```javascript
// Old data detected in localStorage
→ Migrates to IndexedDB automatically
→ Clears localStorage
→ Shows success notification
```

### 2. Storage Estimation

Real-time storage tracking:
- Shows actual usage in MB/GB
- Displays quota (total available)
- Color-coded warnings

### 3. Cloud Sync Compatible

IndexedDB works with your existing GitHub Gist sync:
- Data saves to IndexedDB first
- Then syncs to cloud (if enabled)
- Loads from cloud on other devices

### 4. Export/Import

Full backup support:
- Export all data as JSON
- Import from JSON backup
- Includes all files in Base64

## 📊 Managing 100+ Applications

### Performance Tips:

1. **Regular Cleanup**
   - Delete old applications you don't need
   - Remove unnecessary files
   - Use clear-data.html to start fresh

2. **File Management**
   - Upload only critical documents
   - Use links for large portfolios
   - Compress PDFs before upload

3. **Search & Filter**
   - Use search to find specific companies
   - Filter by status for quick access
   - Indexed queries are fast even with 1000+ apps

### Storage Calculation:

```
100 applications × 5MB average per app = 500MB
Still plenty of room in 1GB+ quota!
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Data Not Loading

**Solution:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Check for errors
3. Run: `await idbStorage.getAll()`
4. Should return array of applications

### Issue: Storage Full Warning

**Solution:**
1. Go to clear-data.html
2. Review applications
3. Delete old/unnecessary ones
4. Remove large files

### Issue: Migration Failed

**Solution:**
1. Open console and check error
2. Manually export from localStorage:
   ```javascript
   const data = localStorage.getItem('applications');
   console.log(data); // Copy this
   ```
3. Save to file, then use Import function

### Issue: Files Not Uploading

**Solution:**
1. Check file size (max 50MB)
2. Verify file type (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT only)
3. Try compressing the file
4. Check browser console for errors

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

### Check Database Manually:

Open DevTools (F12) → Application Tab → IndexedDB → JobTrackerDB

You can:
- View all applications
- Inspect individual records
- Delete specific entries
- See actual storage usage

### Export Database:

```javascript
// In browser console
const data = await idbStorage.exportData();
console.log(data);
// Copy and save to file
```

### Import Database:

1. Use "Restore Backup" button
2. Select your exported JSON file
3. Or run in console:
   ```javascript
   const json = `[your data here]`;
   await idbStorage.importData(json);
   ```

### Clear Database Programmatically:

```javascript
// In browser console
await idbStorage.clearAll();
console.log('Database cleared');
```

## 📈 Storage Monitoring

### Check Current Usage:

```javascript
const estimate = await idbStorage.getStorageEstimate();
console.log(`Using ${estimate.usageMB}MB of ${estimate.quotaMB}MB (${estimate.percentUsed}%)`);
```

### Monitor in Real-Time:

The header status updates automatically:
- After adding applications
- After uploading files
- After deleting data

**Need to go back to localStorage?**
Not recommended, but if needed, simply remove the IndexedDB script line from HTML files and the old localStorage code will work (with the old 5MB limit).
