# Job Application Tracker - Setup Guide

## 🎯 Current Issue
The application uses **localStorage** which only stores data on the current browser/device. Data won't sync across devices or persist after clearing browser data.

## 📱 Quick Solution (Works Now!)

### Option 1: Backup & Restore Feature ✅ (Already Added)

I've added **Backup Data** and **Restore Data** buttons to your application.

**How to use:**
1. On your first device, click **"Backup Data"** button
2. This downloads a JSON file with all your applications
3. Upload this file to GitHub in your repository
4. On other devices, download the backup file from GitHub
5. Click **"Restore Data"** button and select the downloaded file
6. Choose to merge or replace existing data

**Benefits:**
- Works immediately, no setup needed
- Complete control over your data
- Can keep multiple backups
- Works offline

## 🔥 Advanced Solution: Firebase Cloud Storage (Automatic Sync)

For automatic syncing across all devices, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create Firebase Project (Free)

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Click "Add project"
3. Enter project name (e.g., "job-tracker")
4. Disable Google Analytics (optional)
5. Click "Create project"

### Step 2: Enable Firestore Database

1. In Firebase Console, click "Firestore Database"
2. Click "Create database"
3. Choose "Start in test mode" (we'll secure it later)
4. Select a location close to you
5. Click "Enable"

### Step 3: Get Your Firebase Config

1. Click the gear icon ⚙️ next to "Project Overview"
2. Select "Project settings"
3. Scroll down to "Your apps"
4. Click the web icon `</>`
5. Register your app with a nickname
6. Copy the `firebaseConfig` object

### Step 4: Update Your Application

1. Open `firebase-config.js`
2. Replace the placeholder config with your actual Firebase config:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY",
    authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "your-project-id",
    storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "123456789",
    appId: "your-app-id"
};
```

3. Uncomment all the code in `firebase-config.js` (remove the `/*` and `*/`)

### Step 5: Add Firebase SDK to HTML

Add these lines in `index.html` before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<!-- Firebase SDK -->
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/9.22.0/firebase-app-compat.js"></script>
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/9.22.0/firebase-firestore-compat.js"></script>
<script src="firebase-config.js"></script>
```

### Step 6: Secure Your Database (Important!)

1. Go to Firestore Database → Rules
2. Replace with these rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /applications/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if true; // For now - add authentication later
    }
  }
}
```

3. Click "Publish"

### Step 7: Test

1. Open your application on one device
2. Add some applications
3. Open on another device with the same GitHub Pages URL
4. Data should automatically sync!

## 🌐 Alternative: GitHub as Database (Medium Complexity)

You can also use GitHub Gist as a simple database:

1. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token
2. Create a private Gist
3. Use GitHub API to read/write data

## 🎓 Recommended Approach

**For immediate use:** Use the Backup/Restore feature (already working!)

**For production use:** Set up Firebase (15 minutes of setup, then automatic forever)

**For GitHub integration:** Use GitHub Gist API (good if you're already using GitHub)
